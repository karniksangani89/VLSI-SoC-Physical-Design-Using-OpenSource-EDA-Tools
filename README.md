# VLSI-SoC-Physical-Design-Using-OpenSource-EDA-Tools

**Day1 : Inception of Open Source EDA, OpenLANE and SKY130 PDK :**

![](Blogs4p-Rep/Soc.jpg)

ASIC Design consist of 3 elements:
1. RTL IP's
2. EDA Tools
3. PDK Data 

PDK (Process Design Kit ) is interface between the FAB and the designer.
It is collection of files used to model a fabrication rocess for EDA Tools used to design an IC

Currently we will be using Google + Skywater Technology based OpenSorce PDK know as Sky130 PDK
Also we will be using OpenSource tool known as OpenLANE which is an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen, Fault, OpenPhySyn, SPEF-Extractor and custom methodology scripts for design exploration and optimization. The flow performs full ASIC implementation steps from RTL all the way down to GDSII.




Day2 : Floorplan and Library Cells

Day3 : Design Library Cell using Magic Layout and ngSpice Characterization.

Day4 : PreLayout Timing Analysis and Clock Tree Synthesis.

Day5 : RTL2GDS using TritonRoute and OpenSTA
